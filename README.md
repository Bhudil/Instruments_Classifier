# Instrument Image Classifier

This project implements a deep learning-based image classifier using the VGG16 architecture to classify images of musical instruments. The classifier is trained on a dataset containing various instrument categories and can predict the instrument in an uploaded image.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language used for coding the project.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: Used for building and training the deep learning model.
- **OpenCV**: Utilized for image processing tasks.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for displaying images and visualizations.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Utilized for various machine learning utilities.
- **Tkinter**: Used for building the graphical user interface (GUI) for image uploading and prediction display.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical computations.
- **PIL (Pillow)**: Utilized for handling image files.
- **Joblib**: Used for saving and loading machine learning models.

## Project Structure

- **`dataset/`**: Contains the training and testing images categorized by instrument types.
- **`train.py`**: Script to train the instrument classifier model.
- **`predict.py`**: Script for predicting instrument categories from individual images.
- **`gui.py`**: Contains the Tkinter-based GUI for uploading and classifying images.
- **`cnn_instruments_classifier.h5`**: Pretrained instrument classifier model.
- **`requirements.txt`**: File containing the necessary dependencies to run the project.

## Usage

1. **Training the Model**:
    - Run `train.py` to train the classifier on the provided dataset.
    - The trained model will be saved as `cnn_instruments_classifier.h5`.

2. **Predicting with Individual Images**:
    - Run `predict.py` and provide the path to the image you want to classify.
    - The script will output the predicted instrument category.

3. **Using the GUI**:
    - Run `gui.py` to open the Tkinter-based interface.
    - Click the "Upload Image" button to select an image for classification.
    - The predicted instrument category will be displayed in the GUI.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Instrument-Image-Classifier.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Instrument-Image-Classifier
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the GUI application:
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```
